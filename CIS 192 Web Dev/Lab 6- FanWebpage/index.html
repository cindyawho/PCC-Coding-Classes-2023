      <p>Rick Riordan is not a musician but he is my favorite author. He is most known for his written work of the <em>Percy Jackson and the Olympian</em> series. I have read the series for a total of about 7 times.</p>
      <p>Here is Rick Riordan's official website: <a href="https://rickriordan.com/">Riordan Website</a>. You can order a copy of <em>The Lightning Thief</em> from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lightning-Thief-Percy-Jackson-Olympians/dp/0786838655/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2F9KFWI5B2YOW&keywords=percy+jackson+and+the+lightning+thief&qid=1694904400&sprefix=percy+jackson+and%2Caps%2C258&sr=8-1">Amazon here</a>.</p>
